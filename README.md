# Facial-keypoints-detction-using-CNN

facial kepoints are important features that need to be detected to perform further processing and build applications on top of it, such as emotion recognition photo effects.

A convolutional Neural Network is constructed and trained to detect 68 facial keypoints. network construction and training is done using pytorch. training and inferencing is done on GPU.
